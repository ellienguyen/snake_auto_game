# Snake Auto Game
Given a plan as an array of strings and a legend to convert every character to the corresponding element, the program can output a self-playing snake game. The snake can automatically find its own way to the food and the food can find a new position after being eaten

## Sample input
`````
plan = ["*******************",
            "* !               *",
            "* O               *",
            "*******************"];
``````
